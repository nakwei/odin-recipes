        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>What Is Toffee?</strong></p>
        <p>Toffee is a candy made by caramelizing sugar with butter. The mixture is heated until it reaches the hard crack stage (at least 300 degrees F), hardened, then broken into pieces.</p>
        <p><strong>Toffee vs. Caramel</strong></p>
        <p>Toffee and caramel have some similarities, but they have a few key differences. Caramel often contains milk or cream, which gives it a thicker and creamier consistency. The candies are also heated to different temperatures during the cooking process.</p>
